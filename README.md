# WemosWithPushbutton2

This project is an extension of Aruna Tennakoon's Wemos Relay switch.  Specifically it adds a manual pushbutton switch to toggle the relay.

Hardware setup:
1. Connect a 10k resistor between 3.3v and D0
2. Connect a momentary pushbutton switch between D0 and GND

To toggle the switch, simply press the pushbutton.
